# k1x

Reproducible Kubernetes environments for development and testing powered by Nix.

k1x is like docker-compose for Kubernetes. Create a `k1x.nix` file describing your setup, run `nix run ...` and you are good to go.

No Kubernetes knowledge required.

**All dependencies managed by Nix**
k1x managed all dependencies using Nix, so you don't have to worry about installing Helm, k3d, kubectl or any other kubernetes developer tool.
